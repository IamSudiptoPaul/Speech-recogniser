The task of building and testing a speech recogniser can be broken down into five stages:
i) Speech data collection and labelling
ii) Feature extraction
iii) Acoustic modelling
iv) Noise compensation
v) Evaluation

The speech recogniser is to be speaker-dependent which means that it will be trained on speech from just a single speaker and should also be tested on speech from only that speaker. The codes will use Python and a variety of Python libraries such as TensorFlow, numpy, matplotlib and scikit-learn.
